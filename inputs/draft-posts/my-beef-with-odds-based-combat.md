# My Beef with Odds-Based Combat

Most wargames resolve combat by adding up the attacker’s strength, comparing it to the defender’s, and turning that into an odds ratio — like 3:1. It's simple, familiar, and quick. But I believe it wildly oversimplifies something that, in reality, is a messy, chaotic, and multi-layered process. Most combat systems use a single random roll to cover every possible factor, from weapon effectiveness to morale breakdowns to pure dumb luck. I think we can — and should — do better.

Combat isn’t one thing; it’s at least eight overlapping questions happening at once:

1. **What’s the maximum kinetic energy the attacking units can project onto the enemy?**
How many bullets, shells, bayonets, and stern looks can they deliver under perfect conditions?

2. **What’s the probability curve across that range?**
Maybe 100 steps between 0% and 100%, but weighted based on conditions — not a flat line.

3. **What’s the actual amount delivered?**
A random pull from the curve above.

4. **What’s the actual effect on the target?**
Casualties, broken radios, abandoned tanks, shattered morale — again, random, and again influenced by context.

And then, of course, the same four steps happen for the other side.

We need abstraction for a playable game — no question — but collapsing all this into a single random number based on a ratio feels wrong to me. Odds-based combat can sometimes approximate reasonable outcomes, but it breaks down badly at the edges — and, worse, it subtly warps the way players think about real-world combat.

## The Problems with Odds-Based Combat

Before diving into specifics, it's worth asking: why does this even matter?
Because the combat system defines a wargame. It shapes whether battles feel plausible or ridiculous, whether luck feels thrilling or frustrating, and whether players make historically grounded decisions or not. When a system’s foundation is shaky, even the best map, OOB, and scenario design can’t save the experience. Odds-based combat, in my view, starts with the wrong foundation.

### It Conflates the Ability to Deal Damage with the Ability to Absorb It

Combat boils down to two separate random processes: how much force you can unleash, and how much you can absorb. Odds-based systems jam these into a single dimension.

When you calculate a 3:1 ratio, what exactly is being measured? Firepower? Resilience? Morale? Armor thickness?
It tries to do too much with a single number — and that's why we end up needing a pile of modifiers to "fix" obvious contradictions.

Imagine a WW2 light tank unit, led by the best tankers in history, attacking a unit of heavy tanks with green crews. The light tanks might dodge well, flank smartly, and cause temporary chaos — but their guns can’t seriously harm heavy armor. Conversely, even a clumsy heavy tank unit can wreck light tanks when they get a hit. How does a single 3:1 or 1:3 odds ratio capture that?

### It Offers Too Few Possible Outcomes

Typical CRTs (Combat Results Tables) are based on 1d6, 2d6, or 1d10 rolls — six, eleven or ten outcomes. That's not nearly enough to model real-world variance.

Even if we just assume two possible results (good or bad) for each of the four random processes I outlined earlier, that’s 16 combinations. If you add just six gradations per process, that's 1,296 combinations.

More possible outcomes mean long tails, freak events, marginal victories, and (critically) no effect results — all of which happen constantly in real battles. It also means you can separate the effect on Side A from the effect on Side B, rather than tying them together in a zero-sum dance.

### It Misinterprets the 3:1 Rule

Odds-based combat systems likely owe their existence to the U.S. Army’s famous 3:1 rule — the idea that attackers need a 3:1 advantage to have a good chance of success. But that rule is about absorbing the enemy’s fire as much as it is about delivering your own.

You don't automatically win just because you have 3x the numbers; you win because you can lose 2x as much and still keep going. Odds-based combat forgets that subtlety and treats force ratios as a magic key to victory.

### Tradition Is a Hell of a Drug

In the end, I think odds-based systems stuck around because they’re easy to design, easy to teach, and players have been trained to expect them. They’re the standard — but just because something is standard doesn’t mean it’s good.

If we want wargames that feel richer, more unpredictable, and closer to the real-world chaos they’re meant to model, we need to think beyond simple odds.
