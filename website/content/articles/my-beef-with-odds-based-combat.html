<h2>My Beef with Odds-Based Combat</h2>
<p>Most wargames resolve combat by adding up the attacker’s strength, comparing it to the defender’s, and turning that into an odds ratio — like 3:1. It's simple, familiar, and quick. But I believe it wildly oversimplifies something that, in reality, is a messy, chaotic, and multi-layered process. Most combat systems use a single random roll to cover every possible factor, from weapon effectiveness to morale breakdowns to pure dumb luck. I think we can — and should — do better.</p>
<p>Combat isn’t one thing; it’s at least eight overlapping questions happening at once:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What’s the maximum kinetic energy the attacking units can project onto the enemy?</strong></p>
    <p>How many bullets, shells, bayonets, and stern looks can they deliver under perfect conditions?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What’s the probability curve across that range?</strong></p>
    <p>Maybe 100 steps between 0% and 100%, but weighted based on conditions — not a flat line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What’s the actual amount delivered?</strong></p>
    <p>A random pull from the curve above.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
