            <h2>My Beef with Odds-Based Combat Resolution</h2>
            <p>Most wargames resolve combat by adding up the attacker’s
              strength, comparing
              it to the defender’s, and turning that into an odds ratio — like
              3:1. It's
              simple, familiar, and quick. But I believe it wildly
              oversimplifies something
              that, in reality, is a messy, chaotic, and multi-layered process.
              Most combat
              systems use a single random roll to cover every possible factor,
              from weapon
              effectiveness to morale breakdowns to pure dumb luck. I think we
              can — and
              should — do better.</p>

            <p>Combat isn’t one thing; it’s at least eight overlapping questions
              happening
              at once:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p><strong>What’s the maximum kinetic energy the attacking units
                    can project
                    onto the enemy?</strong></p>
                <p>How many bullets, shells, bayonets, and stern looks can they
                  deliver
                  under perfect conditions?</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p><strong>What’s the probability curve across that
                    range?</strong></p>
                <p>Maybe 100 steps between 0% and 100%, but weighted based on
                  conditions —
                  not a flat line.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p><strong>What’s the actual amount delivered?</strong></p>
                <p>A random pull from the curve above.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p><strong>What’s the actual effect on the target?</strong></p>
                <p>Casualties, broken radios, abandoned tanks, shattered morale
                  — again,
                  random, and again influenced by context.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>And then, of course, the same four steps happen for the other
              side.</p>

            <p>We need abstraction for a playable game — no question — but
              collapsing all
              this into a single random number based on a ratio feels wrong to
              me.
              Odds-based combat can sometimes approximate reasonable outcomes,
              but it breaks
              down badly at the edges — and, worse, it subtly warps the way
              players think
              about real-world combat.</p>

            <h3>The Problems with Odds-Based Combat</h3>

            <p>Before diving into specifics, it's worth asking: why does this
              even
              matter?</p>

            <p>Because the combat system defines a wargame. It shapes whether
              battles feel
              plausible or ridiculous, whether luck feels thrilling or
              frustrating, and
              whether players make historically grounded decisions or not. When
              a system’s
              foundation is shaky, even the best map, OOB, and scenario design
              can’t save
              the experience. Odds-based combat, in my view, starts with the
              wrong
              foundation.</p>

            <h4>It Conflates the Ability to Deal Damage with the Ability to
              Absorb It</h4>

            <p>Combat boils down to two separate random processes: how much
              force you can
              unleash, and how much you can absorb. Odds-based systems jam these
              into a
              single dimension.</p>

            <p>When you calculate a 3:1 ratio, what exactly is being measured?
              Firepower?
              Resilience? Morale? Armor thickness? It tries to do too much with
              a single
              number — and that's why we end up needing a pile of modifiers to
              "fix" obvious
              contradictions.</p>

            <p>Imagine a WW2 light tank unit, led by the best tankers in
              history, attacking
              a unit of heavy tanks with green crews. The light tanks might
              dodge well,
              flank smartly, and cause temporary chaos — but their guns can’t
              seriously harm
              heavy armor. Conversely, even a clumsy heavy tank unit can wreck
              light tanks
              when they get a hit. How does a single 3:1 or 1:3 odds ratio
              capture that?</p>

            <h4>It Offers Too Few Possible Outcomes</h4>

            <p>Typical CRTs (Combat Results Tables) are based on 1d6, 2d6, or
              1d10 rolls —
              six, eleven or ten outcomes. That's not nearly enough to model
              real-world
              variance.</p>

            <p>Even if we just assume two possible results (good or bad) for
              each of the
              four random processes I outlined earlier, that’s 16 combinations.
              If you add
              just six gradations per process, that's 1,296 combinations.</p>

            <p>More possible outcomes mean long tails, freak events, marginal
              victories, and
              (critically) no effect results — all of which happen constantly in
              real
              battles. It also means you can separate the effect on Side A from
              the effect
              on Side B, rather than tying them together in a zero-sum
              dance.</p>

            <h4>It Misinterprets the 3:1 Rule</h4>

            <p>Odds-based combat systems likely owe their existence to the U.S.
              Army’s
              famous 3:1 rule — the idea that attackers need a 3:1 advantage to
              have a good
              chance of success. But that rule is about absorbing the enemy’s
              fire as much
              as it is about delivering your own.</p>

            <p>You don't automatically win just because you have 3x the numbers;
              you win
              because you can lose 2x as much and still keep going. Odds-based
              combat
              forgets that subtlety and treats force ratios as a magic key to
              victory.</p>

            <h4>Tradition Is a Hell of a Drug</h4>

            <p>In the end, I think odds-based systems stuck around because
              they’re easy to
              design, easy to teach, and players have been trained to expect
              them. They’re
              the standard — but just because something is standard doesn’t mean
              it’s
              good.</p>

            <p>If we want wargames that feel richer, more unpredictable, and
              closer to the
              real-world chaos they’re meant to model, we need to think beyond
              simple
              odds.</p>
