            <h2>What Makes for a Good Game?</h2>
            <p><strong>Posted on:</strong> April 20, 2021</p>
            <p>I have loved board gaming since I was a young kid. Set up the
              board, draw cards, roll the dice, let's go! I especially love
              games that simulate historical events. These are games where the
              theme is paramount. Nobody would claim that Monopoly is a
              simulation of the real-estate business. History, on the other
              hand, and military history especially, are ripe for games that are
              fun to play AND give you a sense of what the real event might have
              been like. The role-playing aspect of these board games is my
              sweet spot.</p>

It was also a battle of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (England, Scotland and Ireland) of 1639 - 1653. Oil on canvas by John Barker (19th century); 101.6x152.5 cm."</p>
